# Employee-database
Summer Internship 

 In order to run the project:

1. Unzip the file.
2. Copy the folders project and project2 anywhere you wish.
3. Copy file named icon.gif (ATTACHED IN THE MAIL) to C drive. The path should be C://
(NO SUBFOLDER! )
4. There are 2 pdfs ,namely, r2 and blank (ATTACHED IN THE MAIL).
5. Copy them anywhere you wish. r2 is the pdf in which data is inserted. Blank pdf initially contains nothing, but after the program execution contains the contents of the modified pdf. A blank pdf is necessary, as it shall be the target file onto which data is written.
6.  For database, a local connection with username=root and password=root at port number 3306 is required. There should be a database created by the name of db. I didn't ask for user name, password, database name in the program because it would have resulted in many Message boxes. If need be, I can include that too.

7.  The libraries required by the JAVA program are present in the two folders , in the subfolder Project\dist\lib and Proj2\dist\lib . they need not be downloaded.
Open Project\dist and click on Project jar file and enter values for designation, department, post applied for, name, father's name and card number. Click on create table to create the table and then on insert to insert the data in the table.
In the Proj2 folder, click on dist subfolder and then on Proj2 jar file. Enter value for card number and click on fetch record. The record with the given card number will be displayed. Click on insert to insert these values in the pdf, the names of the files have to be specified in the open file dialog box. First select destination of r2.pdf. Later on, another dialog box opens, where in you select the destination of the blank.pdf.
